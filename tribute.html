		<p>Fritz Haber was one of the most famous chemists from the 1900s. 
		He was born in Breslau, Germany in December 9, 1868 into a middle
		class Jewish family. He studied chemistry and during his Ph.D. studies
		he worked on one of the most important industrial chemical reactions 
		still used today. This is of course known as the 
		<a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.the-compost-gardener.com/haber-process.html"
		target="_blank">Bosch-Haber process</a>
		which is the process by which molecular Nitrogen is converted into ammonia.
		The Haber process is the process by which abundant chemicals in the air
		(Nitrogen and Hydrogen) are catalyzed by an iron atom to produce ammonia.
		Haber studied the production of ammonia from air chemicals using sophisticated
		and highly experimental equipment. His work led him to a leadership role
		in the biggest chemical manufacturer in the world, BASF. Haber sold his 
		patent to BASF and became very wealthy.</p> 
		<p>By 1911, Haber wanted to appeal to
		German Nationalism so he joined the military. When world war 1 started, 
		Haber founded the chemical weapons divison of the German military and 
		produced chlorine gas bombs. His deadly chemical weapon had concerning 
		lethal effects and became banned after the war in 1919. After the war, Haber
		recieved the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on the Haber process in 1919.
		Haber remained
		in Germany as a professor of the Berlin Polytecnic university as head of
		the department of chemistry until 1933 when Hitler and Nazis drove 
		German jewish scientists to emmigrate from Germany. Haber moved to 
		London in 1931 and died shortly afterward in 1934.
